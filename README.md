Definition of a new bank model, where you can control your money

The manifesto is to create a multiplatform banking platform (API) as a replacement for PayPal for freelancer, individuals, small businesses, etc. that allows:
 
1. Open an account in fiat currency (USD, Euro) and / or Crypto (eg USDC, DAI) regardless of the country of residence.
2. Receive money via external channels (ex. P2P, Deposit windows, wire transfer)
3. Make internal and external transfers (ex. TheBank to BofA or viceversa)
4. Create account book (bookmarks for quick transactions)
5. View transaction history
6. View balance in fiat currency and / or cryptocurrency
7. Apply for an international debit (and credit) card, backed with the money in the account.
8. Make payments for services to third parties (ex. Electricity, water, telephony)
